# Plant It!
UNH students and alum participated in a hackathon at the 2017 Google Developer Conference at Southern CT State University. Brandon Knieriem (CSMS '17), Philip Levine (CSMS '18), Matthew Vastarelli (CSMS '18), and Yilan “Amanda” Zhu (EEBS ’16) were prompted to use conference technology topics to create a software solution that would inspire elementary aged girls to pursue STEM studies. The team chose to create a mobile virtual reality solution on the Android Google Daydream platform called Plant It!

## In Sum
Plant It! transports the player to a virtual garden where they seed, water, sun, and pick flowers. The prototype is an accessible arcade game where players would aim the Daydream controller and launch seeds, water, and sunlight at their garden. Players attempt to
achieve points for the course based on the number of managed plants. There is no lose condition because we want to encourage players to challenge themselves to achieve the goal of the game with the least number of the most accurate aims.

The team used low-poly assets to create something mobile friendly. However, low-poly art also creates a fun, cartoon-like theme. Future functionality may include educational or zen experiences; raising plants to learn about botany or caring for a virtual garden in a zen-like game mode.

## In Detail
The game has a series of stages. First, players are tasked with planting seeds. The player is not allowed to progress to the
next stage until all seeds have been planted. This rule holds true for all stages; planting seeds, raising sprouts with water, 
maintaining sprouts with sunlight, and picking grown flowers.

There is no timer, game over screen, or other stressful end condition. Instead, we opted for a stress free condition that
encourages friendly competition.

## Looking Forward
This prototype is merely a glimpse of what could be. We imagine opportunities for educational applications and a larger, 
casual game wherein the player maintains a garden (or farm!) over an extended period of time. The user may be able to
customize where and what they plant. We may introduce husbandry, as well!
