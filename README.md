# Plant-It
A VR game meant to inspire young women to become engineers.

## In Sum
An arcade game wherein the player plants seeds, waters the pots, sun the sprouts, and pick flowers. Players attempt to
achieve par for the course based on the number of managed plants. There is no lose condition because we want to encourage 

## In Detail

The game has a series of stages. First, players are tasked with planting seeds. The player is not allowed to progress to the
next stage until all seeds have been planted. This rule holds true for all stages; planting seeds, raising sprouts with water, 
maintaining sprouts with sunlight, and picking grown flowers.

There is no timer, game over screen, or other stressful end condition. Instead, we opted for a stress free condition that
encourages friendly competition.

## Looking Forward

This prototype is merely a glimpse of what could be. We imagine opportunities for educational applications and a larger, 
casual game wherein the player maintains a garden (or farm!) over an extended period of time. The user may be able to
customize where and what they plant. We may introduce husbandry, as well!
